# Productivity Chrome Extension
With this chrome extension you can block websites that are distracting and set timers for length between breaks and the length of the break itself. 

It also includes a timer, so you can keep track of the times between your breaks. 

For extra inspiration, a motivational quote will pop on the top right of your current tab periodically. These quotes will also be added onto a message archive, which is accessible from the options or timer page.
